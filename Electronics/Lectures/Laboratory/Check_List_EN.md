# Laboratory Safety Checklist



## BEFORE POWERING ANY CIRCUIT

☐ Verify all connections visually 
☐ Check component placement (no shorted rows on breadboard etc.) 
☐ Confirm correct polarity (LEDs, capacitors, power rails) 
☐ Ensure power supply voltage is set correctly 
☐ Set current limit to a safe low value 
☐ Confirm multimeter probes are in correct terminals 
☐ Verify oscilloscope probe attenuation (1x / 10x match) 

**Power is the LAST step — not the first.**



## MULTIMETER SAFETY

☐ Voltage → Measure in parallel 
☐ Current → Measure in series only 
☐ Resistance → Power OFF only
☐ After measuring current, move probe back to V terminal 
☐ Never measure current across a power supply 

**If unsure: STOP and re-check.**




## POWER SUPPLY SAFETY

☐ Output OFF before connecting circuit 
☐ Set voltage before enabling output 
☐ Set current limit before enabling output 
☐ Never exceed component ratings 
☐ Do not short output intentionally (except brief demo)

**If the supply switches to CC mode unexpectedly: Turn OFF and inspect wiring.**



## FUNCTION GENERATOR SAFETY

☐ Start with low amplitude 
☐ Confirm offset is appropriate 
☐ Connect ground properly 
☐ Verify output impedance assumptions

**Large amplitudes can destroy small circuits.**




## OSCILLOSCOPE SAFETY

☐ Connect ground clip first 
☐ Ground clip must go to circuit ground only 
☐ Never connect ground clip to a high-voltage node 
☐ Check probe setting (1x / 10x) 
☐ Verify Volts/div before interpreting signal

**Remember: Oscilloscope ground is usually earth-referenced.**



## GENERAL LAB RULES

☐ No loose wires
☐ No exposed conductors touching metal surfaces
☐ Keep workspace organized
☐ Do not work when tired or distracted
☐ Ask before applying unknown voltages



## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

☐ Turn OFF power immediately
☐ Do not touch components blindly
☐ Check smell, heat, wiring
☐ Ask instructor if unsure



## GOLDEN RULE

**Think before switching ON.** Most damage happens in the first second.
