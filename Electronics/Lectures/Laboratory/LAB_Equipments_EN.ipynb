    "# Laboratory Instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building or measuring anything, we must understand **what laboratory tools really are**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A laboratory instrument is not a mysterious box.  \n",
    "It is simply a device that either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connects** electrical elements  \n",
    "- **Measures** electrical quantities  \n",
    "- **Generates** electrical signals  \n",
    "- **Supplies** controlled electrical energy  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand this classification, the laboratory becomes simple.\n",

    "## The Four Fundamental Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category   | Tool Example        | What It Does |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Connect    | *Breadboard*          | Allows us to build circuits |\n",
    "| Measure    | *Multimeter, Oscilloscope* | Observes electrical quantities |\n",
    "| Generate   | *Function Generator*  | Produces controlled test signals |\n",
    "| Supply     | *Power Supply*        | Provides stable electrical energy |\n",

    "2. **Supply** it with energy  \n",
    "3. **Stimulate** it with a signal  \n",

    "## What Is a Signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "A signal is simply a **physical quantity that changes with time**. In electronics, the signal is usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Voltage\n",
    "- Current\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time we observe: $V(t)$ Voltage as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Experimental Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter the laboratory, you are not “using devices”. You are quering the system (circuit) by asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What happens if I apply this voltage?\n",
    "- How does the system respond to this frequency?\n",
    "- Does theory match measurement?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The instruments are just tools that allow you to see the answer.**\n",

    "<div style=\"border:6px solid #007acc; background-color:#ddd; color:#000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Before touching any instrument:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Never assume connections — verify them**.\n",
    "- **Always start with low voltage.**\n",
    "- **Think before switching to current measurement.**\n",
    "- **Never measure resistance in a powered circuit.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good laboratory practice is more important than speed.\n",

    "## 1. What Is a Breadboard?\n",
    "\n",
    "A breadboard is a **temporary wiring platform**. It allows us to build circuits **without soldering**.\n",
    "Inside the breadboard there are hidden metal strips that connect certain holes together.  \n",
    "If you understand these internal connections, you understand the breadboard.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Internal Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard breadboard has three main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Power Rails (Sides)**\n",
    "2. **Terminal Strips (Middle Area)**\n",
    "3. **Central Gap**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figs/Instruments/breadboard.png\" align=\"center\" width=500 style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Rails\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long vertical columns on the sides\n",
    "- Usually marked with red (+) and blue (–)\n",
    "- Used to distribute power (Vcc and GND)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠ Important: On many breadboards, the power rails are split in the middle.  \n",
    "They may not be connected from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal Strips (Working Area)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short horizontal rows of 5 holes\n",
    "- Each row of 5 holes is internally connected\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you place a wire in one hole of a row, all 5 holes in that row are electrically connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Central Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "The gap in the middle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separates the left and right sides\n",
    "- Allows integrated circuits (ICs) to sit across the gap\n",
    "- The two sides of the gap are NOT connected\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the breadboard as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many small metal bridges hidden under plastic\n",
    "- Each row is a small bus\n",
    "- The side rails are long buses for power\n",
    "\n",
    "**It does not create a circuit. It only connects components.**\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",

    "## 4. First Example: LED Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build the simplest circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power supply\n",
    "- Resistor\n",
    "- LED\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1 – Place the Resistor:\n",
    "  - Insert resistor legs into two different rows.\n",
    "  - Important: Both legs must NOT be in the same row. Otherwise it is shorted.\n",
    "* Step 2 – Place the LED\n",
    "  - Long leg → Positive side\n",
    "  - Short leg → Ground side \n",
    "  Again: each leg must be in a different row.\n",
    "* Step 3 – Connect Power\n",
    "  - Connect + from power supply to resistor\n",
    "  - Connect LED to ground rail\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have: Power → Resistor → LED → Ground\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Common Beginner Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mistake 1: Same Row Connection:** If both legs of a component are in the same row,the component does nothing.\n",
    "* **Mistake 2: Rail Assumption:** Assuming the side rail is continuous when it is split.\n",
    "* **Mistake 3: Messy Wiring:** Long wires create:\n",
    "  - Confusion\n",
    "  - Noise\n",
    "  - Debugging problems\n",
    "    Keep wires short and organized.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Good Breadboard Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use red wires for positive**\n",
    "- **Use black or blue wires for ground**\n",
    "- **Keep signal wires different colors**\n",
    "- **Build from left to right**\n",
    "- **Check connections before powering**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discipline in wiring saves hours of debugging.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What the Breadboard Does NOT Do\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit current\n",
    "- Protect components\n",
    "- Check correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only a connection matrix. You are responsible for the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The breadboard is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A temporary wiring platform\n",
    "- A matrix of hidden connections\n",
    "- The starting point of every laboratory circuit\n",

    "\n",
    "For beginners, we focus on three modes only:\n",

    "1. **Voltage (V)**\n",
    "2. **Current (A or mA)**\n",
    "3. **Resistance (Ω)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand these three properly, you can safely perform most laboratory measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Measuring Voltage** (Most Common Mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Is Voltage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage is a **difference in electric potential between two points**. <u>We measure voltage **between two nodes**.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Connect the Multimeter**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the dial to DC Voltage (V⎓)\n",
    "- Black probe → COM terminal\n",
    "- Red probe → V terminal\n",
    "- Connect probes **in parallel** with the component\n",

    "\n",
    "Very important: Voltage is always measured **in parallel**.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where beginners make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is Current?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current is the flow of charge through a component.** Unlike voltage, current flows *through* a branch.\n",

    "A laboratory power supply provides:\n",
    "- A stable voltage\n",
    "- A controlled current\n",
    "- Adjustable output\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as: A **smart battery** with protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a battery, you can:\n",
    "- Adjust voltage\n",
    "- Limit current\n",
    "- Monitor consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Three Main Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Most laboratory power supplies allow you to set:\n",
    "1. Voltage (V)\n",
    "2. Current Limit (A)\n",
    "3. Output ON/OFF\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the only controls beginners must understand at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Voltage Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage knob sets the desired output voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- 5 V for digital circuits\n",
    "- 9–12 V for small analog experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The power supply will try to maintain this voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Current Limit (Very Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "The current limit defines: The maximum current the supply will allow to flow. This is protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your circuit tries to draw too much current:\n",
    "- The supply switches to current-limited mode\n",
    "- Voltage drops automatically\n",

    "Most supplies operate in two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### CV – Constant Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Voltage is stable\n",
    "- Current varies depending on load\n",

    "### CC – Constant Current\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current limit has been reached\n",
    "- Voltage is reduced automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens if:\n",
    "- There is a short circuit\n",
    "- The circuit draws too much current\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Safe Startup Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Before connecting your circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn output OFF\n",
    "2. Set voltage to desired value\n",
    "3. Set current limit to a safe low value\n",
    "4. Connect the circuit\n",
    "5. Turn output ON\n",
    "\n",
    "Never connect a circuit to an active unknown voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Choosing a Safe Current Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "For small beginner circuits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LEDs → 20 mA max\n",
    "- Small breadboard circuits → 100–200 mA safe limit\n",
    "\n",
    "If unsure:\n",
    "Start low. Increase slowly. Protection is better than replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
